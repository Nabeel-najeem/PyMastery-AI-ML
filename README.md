## 🛠 Technical Focus
- **Advanced OOP:** Modular system design using Inheritance and Abstraction.
- **Data Engineering:** Building resilient pipelines with NumPy and Pandas.
- **Computer Vision:** Real-time processing, edge detection, and color targeting.
- **Interaction Design:** Gesture-based control and screen positioning logic.
